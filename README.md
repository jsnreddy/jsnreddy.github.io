# Surendranath Reddy Jillella
A Software Professional with experience in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing and Understanding. Worked on development of solutions to solve real world problems using unstructured text processing and pursues innovation in solving exciting and interesting problems.

## Work Experience
* Senior AI Engineer at [IMImobile](https://imimobile.com/) from July 2019
* NLP Engineer at [IMImobile](https://imimobile.com/) from December 2017 to June 2019
* Research Associate at [Abzooba](https://abzooba.com/) from August 2015 to November 2017

## Education
* Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati between 2011 and 2015

## Projects
 
### Alfred
* Designed and developed the intent and entity recognition engine for IMIbot
* Worked with latest open-source libraries and 3rd Party NLP Engines to build the intent recognition engine
* Worked on latest NLP techniques, linguistic rules, feature engineering for Machine Learning Models for 
  * Intent Classifier, 
  * Entity Tagger
  * Wordforms Generation, 
  * Question Detection
* Responsible for building the deployment scripts and logging for maintainability

### Xpresso
* Worked on latest NLP techniques, linguistic rules, feature engineering for Machine Learning Models for expressions classifier
* Used word-vectors to solve unsupervised NLP problems like 
  * Aspect categorization, 
  * Semantic information retrieval, 
  * Ontology building
* Worked on the development of aspect-based sentiment analysis and trend detection modules in Xpresso
* Worked on various POCs including multitude of 
  * domains
    * Tax services, 
    * Dining & hospitality, 
    * Government, 
    * Electronics(laptops and mobiles)) 
  * and problems
    * Resume scoring,
    * Fund recommendations based on chat-bot conversations
* Responsible for the deployment of the Xpresso engine


### Subrogation Prediction
* Worked as lead developer in implementation of NLP rules that analyze the text notes written by adjusters to extract features for the Machine Learning model to find the probability of subrogation in the case
* Worked with NLP techniques like dependency parsing, POS tagging, lemmatization to build rules for feature extraction
* Also worked with word-vectors to build domain ontology for this domain and identify concepts in a given adjuster note

### Email Classifier
* The project objective was to classify emails from retail merchants and suppliers into 10 categories based on the content of the emails
* Worked as lead developer in the implementation of the natural language based email classifier, which identifies the semantic information in the text of the email
* This was achieved using a rule-based feature extraction. The rules were based on the dependency graph and POS tagging of the sentences
* Responsible for the deployment of the solution in client environment(test and production) starting from building the required environment to the final production deployment
* Was an integral part of the discussions with the client throughout the development phase and also during post-production support. This helped in understanding the requirement better and also fastened the process of implementing the feedback into the system

### Identifying accuracy issues in food orders
* Worked on identifying such Accuracy issues in food orders received by a client through feedback from social media, internal feedback data,email feedback,etc. based on text analysis using Xpresso
* Worked using dependency parsing and POS tagging of the feedback text received
