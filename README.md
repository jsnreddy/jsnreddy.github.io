## Projects
 
### Alfred - Intent and Entity recognition engine for IMIbot
##### Role
Lead Developer
* Worked with latest open-source libraries and 3rd Party NLP Engines to build the intent recognition engine
* Worked on latest NLP techniques, linguistic rules, feature engineering for Machine Learning Models for 
  * Intent Classifier, 
  * Entity Tagger
  * Wordforms Generation, 
  * Question Detection
* Responsible for building the deployment scripts and logging for maintainability

### Xpresso - Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis Engine
* Worked on the development of aspect-based sentiment analysis and trend detection modules in Xpresso
* Used word-vectors to solve unsupervised NLP problems like 
  * Aspect categorization, 
  * Semantic information retrieval, 
  * Ontology building
* Worked on various POCs including multitude of 
  * domains
    * Tax services, 
    * Dining & hospitality, 
    * Government, 
    * Electronics(laptops and mobiles)) 
  * and problems
    * Resume scoring,
    * Fund recommendations based on chat-bot conversations
* Responsible for the deployment of the Xpresso engine


### Subrogation Prediction
##### Objective
To find the probability of subrogation in the case using adjuster's notes
##### Role
Lead NLP Engineer
* Developed NLP rules that analyze the text notes written by adjusters to extract features for the Machine Learning model to find the probability of subrogation in the case
* NLP techniques used - dependency parsing, POS tagging, lemmatization to build rules for feature extraction
* Also worked with word-vectors to build domain ontology for this domain and identify concepts in a given adjuster note

### Email Classifier
##### Objective
Classify emails from retail merchants and suppliers into 10 categories based on the content of the emails
##### Role
NLP Engineer
* This was achieved using a rule-based feature extraction which identifies the semantic information in the text of the email. The rules were based on the dependency graph and POS tagging of the sentences
* Responsible for the deployment of the solution in client environment(test and production) starting from building the required environment to the final production deployment
* Was an integral part of the discussions with the client throughout the development phase and also during post-production support. This helped in understanding the requirement better and also fastened the process of implementing the feedback into the system

### Identifying accuracy issues in food orders
##### Objective
To identify accuracy issues in food orders
##### Role
NLP Engineer
* Data - feedback received by the client(retail food chain) from social media, email and internal feedback data etc.
* Text analysis done using Xpresso
* Used dependency parsing and POS tagging of the feedback text received
